subquestion: |
 Use this interview to help you notify your lessor (the company or person who leased you the vehicle) that you want to end your lease early under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).
  
  Under the SCRA, you can end your lease early without penalty if:

  - Your orders or entry are for at least 180 days  
  - You give your lessor written notice and a copy of your military orders, and
  - You return the vehicle no later than 15 days after the lessor has received notice

  If you follow these steps, your lease should end as soon as you turn in the vehicle. Again, the vehicle needs to be turned in no later than 15 days after written notice has been given.
 
  <b>Please Note: This is not legal advice.</b> If you have detailed questions about terminating your lease under the SCRA, you should contact a lawyer. You can [search for legal assistance](https://www.statesidelegal.org/stateside-map) using StatesideLegal's Find Legal Help tool. 
  
  You can learn more about the SCRA in the video [What is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act?](https://www.statesidelegal.org/what-servicemembers-civil-relief-act-video) at StatesideLegal.org.
